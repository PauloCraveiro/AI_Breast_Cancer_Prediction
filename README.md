# AI_BREAST_CANCER_PREDICTION
This is my Artificial Intelligence(2020) project, made with two colleagues during our Computer Engineering Degree.
The objective was to develop a neural network that was able to, given the values of the breast cancer analysis, classify the cancer as Benign or Malign.

We were able to achieve a model with an accuracy above 98%.
